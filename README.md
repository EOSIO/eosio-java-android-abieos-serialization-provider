Android ABIEOS Serialization Provider is a pluggable serialization provider for EOSIO SDK for Java.

Serialization providers are responsible for ABI-driven transaction and action serialization and deserialization between JSON and binary data representations. This particular serialization provider wraps ABIEOS, a C/C++ library that facilitates this conversion.

## Prerequisites

* Android Studio 3.3.2 or higher
* NDK 18+ (C++ 17 standard support required)
* Cmake 3.6.0+
* Gradle 4.10.1+
* Gradle Plugin 3.3.0+
* For Android, Android 6 (Marshmallow)+

This project relies on platform functionality and libraries only present in Android 6+ and the Android NDK. Therefore, any project depending on ABIEOS Serialization Provider with [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) **must be an Android 6+ project**. Other serialization providers, however, can be created to support earlier Android versions or other platforms. If your project requires earlier Android version or alternate platform support, or if you'd like to create a serialization provider and have questions, please reach out to us by [logging an issue](/../../issues/new).

## Installation

ABIEOS Serialization Provider is intended to be used in conjunction with [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) as a provider plugin.

To use ABIEOS Serialization Provider with EOSIO SDK for Java in your app, add the following modules to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
implementation 'one.block:eosiojava:0.1.2'
implementation 'one.block:eosiojavaandroidabieosserializationprovider:0.1.1'
```

You must also add the following to the `android` section of your application's `build.gradle`:

```groovy
// Needed to get bitcoin-j to produce a valid apk for android.
packagingOptions {
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/darwin/libscrypt.dylib'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/freebsd/libscrypt.so'
    exclude 'lib/x86_64/linux/libscrypt.so'
}
```

The `build.gradle` files for the project currently include configurations for publishing the project to Artifactory.  These should be removed if you are not planning to use Artifactory or you will encounter build errors.  To do so, make the changes marked by comments throughout the files.

Then refresh your gradle project.

Now ABIEOS Serialization Provider is ready for use within EOSIO SDK for Java according to the [EOSIO SDK for Java Basic Usage instructions](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/tree/master#basic-usage).

## Direct Usage

If you wish to use ABIEOS Serialization Provider directly, its public methods can be called like this:

```java
try {
    AbiEos abieos = new AbiEosSerializationProviderImpl()
} catch (SerializationProviderError serializationProviderError) {
    serializationProviderError.printStackTrace();
}

String hex = "1686755CA99DE8E73E1200" // some binary data
String json = "{"name": "John"}" // some JSON

try {
    String jsonToBinaryTransaction = abieos.serializeTransaction(json)
} catch (SerializeTransactionError err) {
    err.printStackTrace();
}

try {
    String binaryToJsonTransaction = abieos.deserializeTransaction(hex)
} catch (DeserializeTransactionError err) {
    err.printStackTrace();
}
```
